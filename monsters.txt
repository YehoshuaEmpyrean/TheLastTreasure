~At first the corpse wings was no more than a chill in the air, a shimmer of mist, diffuse. Through 
~it the furniture and the wallpaper that peeled with the rising damp became slightly out of focus, 
~like a poorly taken photograph.

~The curse face would whimper like a lost child, clutching at a rag doll, it's eyes brimming with 
~silver tears that shone brightly in the moonlight.

@nTheQuickCreeper
~The quick creeper was something of a poltergeist.He was hung by the neck and had his guts 
~cut from him while he was still alive. Now he is restless, unable to rest in peace and full of fury.

~It rose, a mass of tangled limbs, each one armour plated with a paralyzing goo seeping from black pores. The monster clicked it's 
~mandibles and followed me with it's enormous compound eye.

~The tunnel had been abandoned decades before Mike and Jake had been born. Its brickwork 
~had begun to crumble and its mouth gaped black and dank. They exchanged mischievous 
~grins and dared each other to go in.

@nVampire(Boss)
~Without warning the vampire appeared. With skin as pale as freshly poured milk and fangs 
~protruding over the thin blue lips, he stood staring. Running or screaming seemed pointless, 
~then inexplicably the vampire seemed to melt away into the shadows as soundlessly as it had arrived.

@nHunBats
~The monster was a predator. His frontal eyes were better than any hawk and his teeth sharper 
~than steak knives. He moved in the shadows until his victim was in reach and then the 
~tentacles would shoot out and pull them into his mouth.

~The monster didn't need bulk, her muscles were many times stronger than her human prey. 
~She was little more than a wisp of a creature with diminutive limbs and still took down the meal 
~of her choice each dawn.
